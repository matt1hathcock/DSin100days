    "\n",
    "A module is a python file which contains definitions of variables, functions, values and other statements. A module is generally a .py file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A package is a module which contains '_path_' attribute which shows that this module may be interlinked to other modules in an organized heirarchy. This organized system of modules may have code which interacts with each other so as to perform a larger task(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "A published module/package, or set of modules/packages, for reuse in various applications is called a library.Numpy, Pandas, Scikit Learn are all examples of Python libraries. Libraries are created by developers and may be published publicly (open to use for everyone) or privately (use for specific organizations or individuals).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to import a library in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries by themselves are not executable. Libraries often contain modules (.py files) which contain functions, which can be imported into our code and executed.\n",
    "* We can use the 'import' keyword to import libraries in Python.\n",
    "* To import a specific function or module from the library, we can use the 'from' keyword to refer to the specific library that we want to import from and then use the 'import' keyword to refer to the specific module or function to import.\n",

    "\n",
    "Python has a standard library where functions such as print(), range(), len() can be invoked at any point in our code. However, some functions that belong to a category of operations often exist in modules. For example, if we intend to use a logartithm, a square root operation, then such operations exist in a module called the 'math' module. Similarly, there are many modules in python that we can leverage to write our code. These modules need to be imported to use them.\n",

    "import math\n",
    "\n",
    "print(math.sqrt(25))\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Modules are sometimes heavy in terms of memory of functions that are loaded. Also modules are often built up of submodules that could be imported to save memory. Consider a module built of a heirarchy of submodules in this manner:\n",
    "\n",
    "For example consider module A that has submodule B, C, D as submodules. Suppose the submodule D has a function func(), which is all we need for our code. Then, we can import just the submodule in a heirarchial fashion as:\n",
