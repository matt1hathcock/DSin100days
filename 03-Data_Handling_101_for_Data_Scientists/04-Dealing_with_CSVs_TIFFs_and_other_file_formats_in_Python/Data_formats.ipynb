Text files contain data with  no structured relationships between records; they contain only basic formatting and have small fixed number of fields. While reading a text file, you need to specify the access mode of a file through the *mode* argument. This might be ** *r* **, ** *w* ** or ** *a* ** for **read**, **write** and  **append** respectively. Let's say I have a text file *sample.txt* which has the following data: <br><br>\n",

The second and by far the best method, is to import it as a dataframe using the pandas **read_csv()** funtion in python. \n",

    "1. Audio sample rate - The first part of the data that is read, is an integer that conveys the sample rate of the audio data. The higher the sample rate, the more better the audio quality is said to be. The common sample rate could be around 44.1 kHz (or 44100) or higher. The significance and interpretation of this sample rate is that, every second of music/waves, are made up of 44,100 points of wave data.\n",
    "2. Audio wave data - The second part of the the data is a two dimensional array, which signifies the audio wave amplitudes. The audio can have multiple channels. Generally most audio waves have 2 channels - left and right, similar to left and right speakers. Each element of the 2D array is in itself an array with 2 elements - wave amplitudes of left and right channels.\n",

By observation we can see that the wave data, which is amplitudes, can be plotted as an index of time to see how the sound wave would look like over time. Also, the amplitude data has a value for each channel. In the above scenario we see 2 numbers - right channel value and left channel value. Each channel value is to be plotted as a distinct line plot. So amplitude values would be plotted on y-axis and index of the amplitude data can be plotted on x-axis.\n",

    "Now, as mentioned above, based on sample rate we can see how many amplitude data values make up one second of the audio wave. So when the scale of x-axis is adjusted to compress the sample rate number of data values into 1 second's audio data, we can visualize the sound wave on a relatively interpretable scale - the time scale. We do so by manipulating the x-ticks.\n",
